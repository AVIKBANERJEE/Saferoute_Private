Safe_Route is a user friendly web-based navigation platform which revolutionizes the way we navigate today. The platform prioritizes a safest journey over the quickest one.In our platform, we have a real time interactive map interface, where users can provide their source and destination. Once a user provides their information, our system will suggest an optimal route which balances speed and safety.
